    failures by product manufacturers. Their excuses for missteps include security issues, complexities of
     managing product life cycles, and lack of interoperability. But most often the root cause is that IoT
     companies with traditional B2B business models and B2B2C distribution channels have been pushing IoT
     technology rather than addressing the pull of customer needs and tastes.</p></div>
